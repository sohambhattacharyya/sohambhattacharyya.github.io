Site construction is in progress. Experimenting with layout and formatting - the fine tuning. I have integrated some of my social accounts. And it is quite close to be up and running.

The goal for this site will be to showcase my projects, research works and to provide quality, original content targeting anyone interested in electronics, computers, engineering, programming and likely a few other topics about which I am obsessed. I will also use this site to keep a track of my learning experiences as I progress through my career.

While this site is currently viewable on the web, and most likely will appear in certain search results, I am not yet actively promoting it until I furnish any content. As soon as the site gets a complete structure, I hope to offer up all sorts of scintillating thoughts, reflections and wisdom (think electronics), so please check back!
