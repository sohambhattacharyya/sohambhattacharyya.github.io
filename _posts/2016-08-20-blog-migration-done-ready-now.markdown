The site is almost complete and I am paving my way through putting content together. Previously, it was on WordPress with a pre-fab template. Here, I am using [Jekyll][jekyll] on my self-hosted site, as I am getting used to [Markdown][markdown] at the same time. This is something awe-inspiring. The template [Karuna][karuna] was good, though.

Initially, I need to finish the _Introduction to DSP using MATLAB_ series, both for 'blogging practice' and because it will assist me in keeping my cognitive memory of computing at its apex. My projects and other works and experiences also will slip into the content stream parallelly.

Thanks for dropping by. Come back and see how things are progressing. I am eager to begin exploring and sharing amazing topics!
