		Iâ€™m working on LLM, Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Image Processing at TCS in India. Before that, I did my MASc (Master of Applied Science) in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Dalhousie University, Canada. I was supervised by Prof. Dr. Jason Gu (President, IEEE Canada, 2020-2021). The title of my thesis was "Improved Artificial Potential Field Method for Robotic Path Planning".
